# Teaching Actions

The foundation has invested funding and effort (in particular through
the work of Yann Régis-Gianas, teaching representative on the
Executive Board) in the Learn-OCaml technical platform for online
exercises, which powers the OCaml MOOC and several OCaml courses in
university. {.intro}

We are interested in supporting other technical platforms that allow
teaching OCaml to a wide audience, in a school/academic setting or for
self-learning; we would also like to grow an open corpus of teaching
and learning material, and support in-boarding actions towards
non-OCaml programmers.

## OCaml MOOC

We ran sessions of the OCaml MOOC in 2018-2019 (3k registrants, 200
certificates). We employed a TA to help students on the MOOC forums.

## The [Learn-OCaml]({{ '/learn-ocaml' | url }}) Online Exercise Platform

The Learn-OCaml exercise platform is open-source and easy for anyone to deploy
locally to support their OCaml courses.

We relicensed the codebase to MIT, and funded further development of
the platform by OCamlPro. We employed two interns to write
documentation for teachers (platform, exercise-writing...) and
review pedagogical material.

We are actively working on an instance server, to make it easier for
people to deploy new instances for their courses without having to
host one locally -- which is fairly easy to do {.silent}

## OCaml Exercise Corpus Development

We fund teachers to contribute high-quality exercices to a common
exercise database for the Learn-OCaml platform. In particular, we
received 10 high-quality advanced exercices from François Pottier,
and made available 40 exercises from the MOOC.

## Building a Teacher Community

We are trying to build a community of OCaml teacher sharing teaching
documents. We provided financial support for a CS-teaching
conference at the French national level in 2018, and presented our
teaching efforts at the OCaml Workshop on the same year.

## Helping Learn-OCaml Adoption in Universities

We provided some financial support for new OCaml courses in 2018, at
the Paris-Diderot university (France) and McGill University
(Canada). You may be interested in the McGill [ICFP'2019 experience
report](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/papers/learn-ocaml-icfp19)
on their new course using the [Learn-OCaml]({{ '/learn-ocaml' | url }}) platform.

We are funding an initiative in the NOVA University of Lisbon and
the University of Beira Interior (Portugal) to research and teach
the foundations of computer science using OCaml, bringing new
technical developments to the Learn-OCaml platform.

# General OCaml Actions

## Community Events

We sponsor video-capture for the Paris OCaml meetup. (If you would
like to run a regular meetup in another city, feel free to get in
touch!).

We sponsored the [SWERC](https://swerc.eu/2019/about/) programming
contest for 2019-2020, and in return the contest added OCaml to the
list of available languages.

We are sponsoring a development sprint for the
[Owl](https://github.com/owlbarn) project for scientific computing in
OCaml.

## OCaml Language Design & Development

We funded [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internships in 2019
and 2020, to participate in improving the diversity in the OCaml
community.

We funded a research internship on type inference, to study
approaches to keep the type-checker predictable and robust as the
language evolves.

We provide funding for the [Cambium](http://cambium.inria.fr/) research
team at INRIA Paris (France), an active place for OCaml-related fundamental
research (some of the team members are also very active on the implementation
front, for example Xavier Leroy, Damien Doligez, Florian Angeletti, and
Sébastien Hinderer).

We are funding work to improve the OCaml reference manual, and the
documentation on [ocaml.org](ocaml.org).

## Supporting the OCaml Software Ecosystem

We are funding work by Kate Deplaix to improve the compatibility of
the opam-repository ecosystem with new OCaml releases. This work has
been ongoing since OCaml 4.10, and users report quicker and smoother
upgrade process, with most of the ecosystem now compatible at the time
of the release.

## ReasonML

We provided financial support for the ReasonML association in
2018-2019, as it was just starting.
