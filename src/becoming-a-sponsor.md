# Becoming a Sponsor

Supporting the OCaml Software Foundation contributes to supporting and
strengthening the OCaml community. If your company or institution
builds on top of the OCaml programming language, ecosystem and
community -- and if you are interested in supporting our
[actions]({{ '/actions' | url }}) -- please consider becoming a sponsor of the
OCaml Software Foundation.

To become a sponsor, you should choose a sonsporship level below, and
contact the Executive Board ([about us]({{ '/about-us' | url }})), for example
by email at <a class="email"
href="mailto:ocaml.software.foundation@gmail.com">ocaml.software.foundation@gmail.com</a>.

The OCaml Software Foundation is a non-profit foundation of public
interest (legally it is a sub-foundation "fondation abritée" of the
Fondation Partenariale INRIA, located in France).

## Advisory Board

The Advisory Board of the foundation is populated by representatives
of our [sponsors]({{ '/index.html#sponsors' | url }}). It is a forum to share information
among industrial and academic users of OCaml and active members of the
community, to identify and discuss priorities and pain points in the
OCaml community that the foundation can help with.
