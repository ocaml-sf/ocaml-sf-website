# Becoming a Sponsor

Supporting the OCaml Software Foundation contributes to supporting and
strengthening the OCaml community. If your company or institution
builds on top of the OCaml programming language, ecosystem and
community -- and if you are interested in supporting our
[actions](actions.html) -- please consider becoming a sponsor of the
OCaml Software Foundation.

To become a sponsor, you should choose a sonsporship level below, and
contact a member of the Executive Board ([about us](about-us.html)),
for example by email at <a class="email"
href="mailto:gabriel.scherer@gmail.com">gabriel.scherer@gmail.com</a>.

The OCaml Software Foundation is a non-profit foundation of public
interest (legally it is a sub-foundation "fondation abritée" of the
Fondation Partenariale INRIA, located in France).


## Sponsorship levels

Sponsorship levels correspond to the following yearly donations to the foundation:

- Platinum: 50K€ or more
- Gold: 25K€ or more
- Silver: 15K€ or more
- Bronze: 5K€ or more

We also have a specific sponsorship level for academic organizations
(universities, labs, etc.), at 4K€ or more.

Anonymous sponsorship is possible.


## Advisory Board

The Advisory Board of the foundation is populated by representatives
of our [sponsors](index.html#sponsors). It is a forum to share information
among industrial and academic users of OCaml and active members of the
community, to identify and discuss priorities and pain points in the
OCaml community that the foundation can help with.
